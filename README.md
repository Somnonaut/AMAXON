# AMAXON
A free local Main St. store owner web sales initiative to compete with Amazon. 
Main St can fight back
AMAXON
NOTE: I have no idea how to code, nor to pull off any of this. It is only a concept I think would be worthwhile.

1) An open-source project like a Kickstarter to raise funds to pay to write code for an inventory control software. (not sure if funds are needed even)
2) Give software away to Main St shops 
3) Software also coordinates all these mom&pop stores' inventory with location, becoming one big virtual warehouse.
4) When shoppers use the software, it first looks to see how proximate the product is to them via zip code
5) When the purchase is made, then local independent gig drivers deliver said product. This delivery would happen in much less time than Amazon, being that Amazon is stuck in the 90's central spoke and wheel mentality, where everything sold via "Amazon store" has to go into a central warehouse and then be moved again to the end delivery point. This is extremely wasteful and polluting. Why move a product from manufacture to wholesaler, over multiple miles, to warehouse, over multiple miles, to final consumer over multiple miles; when the mom&pop store acts as a mini local distribution center, manufacture to wholesaler, over multiple miles, to mom&pop, over multiple miles, to final consumer, last mile(s).
6) There would be local delivery but many of them are already driving EV and compared to the delivery trucks, they are much less polluting.
